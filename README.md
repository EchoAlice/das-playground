This repository is where I play with concepts that are/will be used within [DAS Prototype](https://github.com/ChainSafe/das-prototype) and [Model DAS](https://github.com/EchoAlice/Model-DAS).



### Current idea to implement:
1.  Spin up DASNodes that instantiate the Discovery Protocol.   
2.  Add information to their routing tables! And their data stores.
3.  Create new routing table
